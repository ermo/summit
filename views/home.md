## Getting started

This is the dashboard for the [Serpent OS](https://serpentos.com) build infrastructure.
In order to contribute, you simply need to send us a pull request to the relevant repository
on GitHub, via the [snekpit](https://github.com/snekpit) organisation.

### Current status

This dashboard, despite being in development for some time, is a __proof of concept__ to make
sure our core tooling is working. The plan of action is to flesh out as much as we can in the
way of packaging before hitting our next major block points (repository releases and system triggers)

### Jumping in

Make sure you have `boulder` and `moss` installed. Grab them via the [onboarding](https://github.com/serpent-os/onboarding) project
to be able to contribute.
